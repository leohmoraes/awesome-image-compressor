# Awesome Image Compressor 

A Plugin for Sketch that compresses your png and jpg assets, to keep filesize to a minimum.
Please note that the compression is lossy.


## Installation 

* Download [Awesome Image Compressor](https://github.com/naoyawatanabe/awesome-image-compressor) & unzip it.
* Double click Awesome Image Compressor.sketchplugin to install the Plugin.


## Usage

The Compression happens automatically, whenever you export an asset from Sketch using the Export button in the toolbar. The Plugin will run your PNG & JPG assets through [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/) and [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim) using the quickest settings for both, so that you get smaller files as fast as possible.
